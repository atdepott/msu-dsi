Classifications have also proceeded at a finer spatial resolution of 8km at a continental scale. In addition to describing vegetative cover according to topological schemes, the project has explored methodologies to represent vegetative cover more realistically as gradients and mosaics of cover types. To identify the pixels to be used for training of the 1 km AVHRR Pathfinder data, we collected a total of over 200 high resolution scenes of which we were confident of which cover type occurs. Most of the scenes used were acquired by the Landsat Multispectral Scanner System (MSS), and a few by Landsat Thematic Mapper and the LISS (Linear Imaging Self-Scanning Sensor), These training data provide the basis for carrying out a global land cover classification. They also provide data for validating other land cover classification products. The methodology and Landsat images used for deriving these training data for classification of AVHRR data at 8km resolution can also be applied to 1km AVHRR data and, in the future, MODIS data at 250m and 500m resolution.

This is an indicator for local food self sufficiency which does not take into account internal or external trade. It is generally estimated that 250 - 500 kg grain per year is required per person to have an adequate diet. The method used is a generalization of the land class approach in which each major AT 2010 zone is associated with an overall agricultural production potential (at low inputs corresponding to 1.2 Ton/ha for the best land) and the soil productivity index is associated with this potential to incorporate the extent of potentially available agricultural land. The result is then divided by the population in the area to obtain an approximation of what amount of grain would be available to each person.",
